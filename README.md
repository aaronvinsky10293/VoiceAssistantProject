# VoiceAssistantDemo

## Description

This project is a voice assistant demo, which comes in 2 parts:

1. A voice assistant that generates a dataframe after a call with statistics about the call.
2. A voice assistant that creates a SQL query based on the user's voice input, and returns the sql query result in natural language.

Additionally, the project contains a script that generates a random dataframe of fake data, which is useful to test the SQL based voice assistant.
